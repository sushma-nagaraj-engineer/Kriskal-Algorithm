# Kriskal-Algorithm

This program will find the minimum spanning tree among a set of cities in Texas. This is a command-line program that uses Kruskal's algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree of a graph. The graph will be provided as a file named assn9_data.csv. The data in the file is in the form of an adjacency list. It uses Disjoint sets and priority queue and it outputs each edge of the minimum spanning tree as the names of the two cities and the distance between them and sum of all of the distances in the tree.
